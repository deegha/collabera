### What we have done here

This is a simple app I created for a interview question I got.

### Project structure

I have followed a simple next js app router project structure. All routers are in app directory. All the reusable components are in the components directory

### How to set up

simply clone the project and

1. install the dependancies
   `yarn install`

2. start the app
   `yarn dev`

### How to run the app

the app has three routes for the three questions

1. /calculator
2. /navbar (with mobile responsive)
3. /sorting

note: for the question 3 make sure to check the answer in the console.
